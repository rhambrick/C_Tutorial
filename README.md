# C Tutorial
This is some example code of core concepts of the C programming language.
I took a crash course on C recently to refresh my memory, pun intended.
This is the code from each chapter that I wrote as I went.
I am not an expert though!
My advice to follow this is to pull the code into a folder on your PC,
then use a code editor like vscode to examine the code and it's plentiful
comments. But also textbooks are about the same in terms of efficiency,
and those are written by actual subject matter experts.

At the end of the day, I still prefer C++, lol!
